# Python2 is a dependency of rules_docker due to its dependency on
# containerregistry. To run builds on environments in which 'which python'
# points to python3, you can use the py_runtime target below.
# To use this target, simply add the following flag to your build commands:
# --python_top=//python:py_runtime_2
# Note you need to have a symlink to a valid python2 version in
# '/usr/bin/python2' for this to work.
# Note this will stop working with Bazel 0.26.0 or whenever
# --incompatible_use_python_toolchains is turned on by default.
# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7899
