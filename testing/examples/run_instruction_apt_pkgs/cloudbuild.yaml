    # Building this example image with rules_docker uses the `download_pkgs`

    # mounted /workspace directory. As a result the `install_pkgs` target is
    # unable to access a file at /tmp/installer.sh to build successfully.
    # Setting the output_base explicitly to a directory we have access to,
    # resolves this issue.
