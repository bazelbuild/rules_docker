"""Test rule for verifying a given container_image target produces a
   deterministic Docker image.

This rule builds the given container_image twice in isolation to determine if
the given image is deterministic.
It does so by mounting the provided Bazel project files into the 'base' image.
Next it starts two containers and builds the supplied container_image target
(being 'image') inside each of the containers. The rule then extracts the
output files for the test image. Finally, both extracted images are compared.
A test image is considered to be reproducible when both instances of the same
image have the same digest and ID. On a mismatch of one of those values, the
test fails (unless want_reproducibility is False) and the container_diff tool
(https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-diff#container-diff)
produces the summary of their differences.

Args:
    image: A container_image target to test for determinism.
    workspace_file: The WORKSPACE file of the project containing the 'image'
                    target to help detect project's root path.
    base: (optional) An image target to build and reproduce the 'image 'in.
          This image must have Bazel and docker installed and available in the PATH.
    container_diff_args: (optional) Args to the container_diff tool as specified here:
                         https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-diff#quickstart
    want_reproducibility: (optional) Flag to indicate whether the test 'image'
                          is expected to be reproducible.

NOTE:

Since every container_repro_test target requires specifying the WORKSPACE file
(in the 'workspace_file' attribute) of the current project (as shown in the
examples below), it is required to have a top level BUILD file exporting the
WORKSPACE file like so:

exports_files(["WORKSPACE"])

Examples:

container_repro_test(
    name = "set_cmd_repro_test",
    image = "//tests/container:set_cmd",
    workspace_file = "//:WORKSPACE",
)

container_repro_test(
