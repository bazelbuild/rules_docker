"""Repository rule for building a Docker image from a Dockerfile and saving it
   into a tar file.

This rule uses either the docker tool installed in the system or the Kaniko
executor container to build the image and then save it as a tar file.
The saved tar file is available for other rules to use (e.g. container_image,
container_load, container_test)

The built docker image is always called after the dockerfile_image target used
to build the image and tagged with `dockerfile_image` (i.e. <target_name>:dockerfile_image).
This means that if an image with name <target_name>:dockerfile_image already
exists and a dockerfile_image target called <target_name> is built, then the
existing image will change its name to <none>:<none> and the newly built image
will get the <target_name>:dockerfile_image name.

The produced tar file is available at @<repo_name>//image:dockerfile_image.tar
