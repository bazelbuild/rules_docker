# Tests that verify the security_check examples of rules_docker.
# Needs to run on GCB as requires access to asci-toolchains images

steps:

  # Pull the docker images used by the tests first.

  # Step to copy the rules_docker repo to a separete persistent volume
  # from the /workspace directory, where GCB copies the project's source
  # code by default.
  # This is needed because the rules_docker repo and Bazel's output_base
  # connot co-exist under the same directory. This is because the 'internal'
  # Bazel project (with examples) uses a `local_repository` target to point to
  # rules_docker repo, which then leads to infinite symlink expansion error
  # when the 'internal' project tries to access files under
  # external/io_bazel_rules_docker.
  # Also the output_base cannot be set to a location outside /workspace, as it
  # leads to the error described in the next step's comment.
